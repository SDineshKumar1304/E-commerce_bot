**You**: hi

**Chatbot**: Hi there! How can I help you today? Are you looking for anything in particular?

**You**: yes i am looking for watches

**Chatbot**: Great! You're looking for watches. To give you the best recommendations, could you tell me a little more about what you're looking for?  For example:

* **What's your budget?** (e.g., under $50, $50-$100, $100-$200, over $200)
* **What style are you interested in?** (e.g., dress watch, sports watch, smartwatch, casual watch)
* **What features are important to you?** (e.g., water resistance, GPS, heart rate monitor)
* **Are you looking for a men's watch, a women's watch, or a unisex watch?**
* **Any preferred brands?**

Once I have a better idea of your preferences, I can point you towards some specific watches and links on Flipkart and Amazon.

In the meantime, here are a few general links to get you started:

* **Flipkart:** [www.flipkart.com/watches/pr?sid=6bo](www.flipkart.com/watches/pr?sid=6bo)  (This will take you to the general watches section on Flipkart.)
* **Amazon:** [www.amazon.in/Watches/b?ie=UTF8&node=1350387031](www.amazon.in/Watches/b?ie=UTF8&node=1350387031) (This will take you to the general watches section on Amazon India.)
